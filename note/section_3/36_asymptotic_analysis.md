# Asymptotic Analysis

漸進式分析

| notation        | means | hint |
|--------------|-------|-------|
|  $\Omega$   |    best case   |    Lower Bound   |
| $O$   |    worst case   |    Upper Bound   |
| $\theta$ |     average case  |       |

In computer science, we always consider the worst case (to make sure our computer compelete the task!)

# Example

linear search a element in `[84, 21, 47, 96, 15]`

Time Complexity

| notation    |
|-------------|
| $\Omega(1)$ |
| $O(n)$      |
|$\theta(n)$|

average case is $\frac{n}{2}$ which is still $n$ by order of growth
