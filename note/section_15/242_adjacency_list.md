## Directed Graph

For each vertex, seprarated list of edges is maintained

vertices point the connecting vertex.

## Weighted Directed Graph

store the vetex and the weights accordingly.

The is a connection between $B$ and $A$. So they have the reference to each other.

# Performance

the exist_edge : $d_u$ means degree of the vetex $u$
